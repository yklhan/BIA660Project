Pros
Big company with a small company feel. Very entrepreneurial. Management facilitates your ideas that push the business forward
Cons
Big company and yes sometimes it takes a while to find the information you are looking for. Global company and sometimes that information is with someone who is on other side of the world.

Pros
Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome.
Cons
You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you.

I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Jeff Bezos and his "S-Team" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth. You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my "Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment."
Cons
The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much "behind the wall" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.

Current Employee - Software Development Manager in Phoenix, AZ

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Amazon full-time for less than a year
Pros
I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction. The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.
Cons
No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that. Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.

Current Employee - Software Development Manager in Seattle, WA
Recommends
Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long. - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue) - A chance to make a huge difference - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions). - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain
Cons
- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.

I worked at Amazon full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.
Cons
Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways. Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to "manage people." The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a "ask no questions, have no introspection" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.

¡ï¡ï¡ï¡ï¡ï
Current Employee - Program Manager

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
So many great reasons to work at Amazon! The pay is competitive. So many leadership opportunities! Benefits are unmatched anywhere else! The atmosphere is casual and laid back, fun, but also gives a sense of professionalism too. Stock options are a bonus! My favorite part is how they are one of the largest companies in the world, with a large corporate base, but I've never had the feeling of working in a "corporate environment". This company has done a great job of making everyone feel like they are in a tight family of Amazonians. Another great part is the continuous improvement! You never feel like we (as a company or as a department) are falling behind the curve in anything we do because of the CI.
Cons
Like any other job, there are possibilities of bad leadership in the company. They try really hard to hire and develop the best, but sometimes a few weeds grow in the cracks. They usually don't last long at Amazon though, so if you can hang tough, you will eventually get that great leader to report to again! The continuous improvement can also be a 'con' if you are not able to keep up with the high rate of change in the company. We move so fast, it can be a struggle to keep up sometimes.

Pros
One of the best reason to work for Amazon is the opportunity to grow. With Amazon you can be everything and anything you want to be because of the different options available to you for development. The company recognizes talent and it develops the talent to be the best in all kinds of situation. Amazon also believes in diversity of people and opinion which makes it easier to find your place within the organization; a place where you can make the most impact.
Cons
The downside is that it's a very fast paced environment where you think on your feet. so if you are the type that needs time to second guess yourself, then that wont be a great place for you to be at.

Pros
Leading the way in diversity and social change. Worthwhile work - especially since the start of the pandemic. Leadership principles are part of everyday conversation, and more importantly evident in the behavior throughout the organization. Opportunities are seemingly unlimited.
Cons
Changes come fast and frequent, which poses a challenge to keep up with. This creates some ambiguity that you may not see in an organization that introduces change at a slower pace, so that requires some adjustment.
